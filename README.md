# Introduction to R for biostatistics

This is a basic, one week intro to R for Biostatistics using R markdown documents. I used it to teach a biostatistics class at University of TÃ¼bingen in March 2016.

Some parts were inspired/adapted from Claus Wilkes Computational Biology and Bioinformatics class (http://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348_spring_2015.html) taught at UT Austin.

Comments appreciated!
